# Analog-Clock
This project is an interactive analog clock designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock updates dynamically, showing the current time based on your device's local time.
The clock features a clean and modern design, with rotating hour, minute, and second hands that mimic the behavior of a real-world analog clock.
